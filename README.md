How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software on a case-by-case basis. First, I gather the requirements that need to be met. Then I write my code to satisfy the requirements.

What new design skills have your work on the project helped you to craft?
The new design skill that I had learned working on this project is integration. Being able to merge different shapes into one object was a great learning experience.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
The design process I followed for my project was using multiple iterations. To keep adjusting my project little by little until  progress was finally made.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Since OpenGL was a whole new world, I believe my research approach to this project can help me in the future.

How do I approach developing programs?
I approach designing a program on a case-by-case basis. First, I gather the requirements that need to be met. Then I write my code to satisfy the requirements.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
The new strategy that I used for my 3D scene was the use of header files. Header files for shaders and drawing a cylinder were very useful.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Iteration was a major factor in my development process. Constant iteration and testing made it possible for me to incrementally improve my project.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
My approach to developing code was constantly evolving throughout the milestones. Learning more C++ and OpenGL concepts each week is what made my project's completion possible.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science will empower me to create my own application one day which is my goal.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
The knowledge of information from this course will help me understand the graphics and the mathematics behind it. The course really reinforced my knowledge of C++ and it gave me a new skill that I can lean on in future courses.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
The knowledge of information from this course will help me understand the graphics side of development. Also, if my career goes toward computer graphics this course is a great foundation.
